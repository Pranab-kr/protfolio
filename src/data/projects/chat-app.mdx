## Overview

**Chatty** is a modern real-time messaging platform focused on fast, responsive conversations and a polished user experience.

---

## Key Features

### Real-time Messaging

- Instant bi-directional messaging via **Socket.io Client**
- Chat list and active conversation view
- Typing / loading skeletons for smoother perceived performance
- Message input with validation and UX-focused interactions

### User & Session Management

- Auth pages for login and signup flows
- Profile and settings pages
- Persistent auth and chat state using **Zustand** stores
- Axios-based API integration for auth and data fetching

### UI & Experience

- Responsive, app-like layout with sidebar + chat container
- Reusable, composable UI primitives (`button`, `input`, `dialog`, `sheet`, etc.)
- Dark/light mode support via theme store
- Skeleton states for sidebar and messages
- Mobile-friendly navigation and drawer/sheet patterns

### Analytics & Insights

- Integrated **Recharts** components for visualizing conversation/activity data
- Dashboard-ready chart primitives wired into the UI system
- Layout components designed for future analytics panels and metrics

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite
- **Routing**: React Router v7
- **State Management**: Zustand (`useAuthStore`, `useChatStore`, `useThemeStore`)
- **UI**:
  - Tailwind CSS v4 (via `@tailwindcss/vite`)
  - shadcn-style component system (buttons, dialogs, forms, sheets, navigation, etc.)
  - Lucide React icons
- **Networking**:
  - Axios for REST API calls
  - Socket.io Client for real-time communication
- **Forms & Validation**: React Hook Form + Zod + `@hookform/resolvers`
- **Charts & Visualization**: Recharts
- **Utilities**: `class-variance-authority`, `tailwind-merge`, `date-fns`, `sonner` / `react-hot-toast` for notifications

---

## How It Works

1. User signs in or creates an account through the auth pages.
2. Auth state is stored in a global **Zustand** store.
3. The main layout renders:
   - Sidebar with conversations / navigation
   - Chat container with header, message list, and input
4. The client connects to the backend via **Socket.io**, subscribing to relevant rooms/channels.
5. Messages are:
   - Sent via Socket.io
   - Reflected optimistically in the UI
   - Synced with the REST API through Axios where needed
6. Charts and analytics components use the same shared state and Axios layer to display conversation metrics.

## Current Status

**Completed**

- Core layout (sidebar, navbar, chat container)
- Auth, profile, and settings pages
- Global theme, auth, and chat stores with Zustand
- UI component library and skeleton states
- Socket.io client integration for messaging
- Chart primitives wired with Recharts
  **Planned**
- Message search and filtering
- Per-conversation settings (mute, pin, archive)
- Read receipts and typing indicators
- Group chats and roles
- In-app notifications and activity feed
- Deeper analytics dashboards (per-user and per-channel stats)

---

## Highlights

- Modern React 19 architecture with Vite dev experience
- Opinionated UI system built on Tailwind v4 + shadcn-style primitives
- Centralized state with Zustand for predictable behavior
- Real-time messaging via Socket.io client
- Ready for analytics and monitoring via Recharts integration
- Clean, reusable component structure for fast feature development

**Chatty demonstrates a production-ready front-end architecture for real-time messaging: performant, extensible, and designed for a polished chat experience.**
