# AniLog – Anime, Manga & Manhwa Tracker
## Overview
**AniLog** is a minimalist, cozy media tracker for anime, manga, and manhwa.
---
## Key Features
### Auth & Onboarding
- Email/password authentication via Better Auth
- Session-based access to the main dashboard
- Protected home page that redirects unauthenticated users to `login`
### Media Library
- Central dashboard (`MediaTabs`) for browsing and filtering media
- Media cards with title, type, status, and progress
- Distinct support for anime, manga, and manhwa entries
- Quick actions for editing entries in place
### Media Management
- Add new media via modal forms (e.g. `AddEntryModal`)
- Edit existing entries with an inline modal (`EditMediaModal`)
- Validation using Zod-based schemas for creating and updating entries
- Status and progress fields for tracking where you left off
### File & Image Handling
- Image upload support using UploadThing
- Drag-and-drop powered uploader (`ImageUploader`)
- Preview and replacement of cover art
- Integration with a custom `file-upload` UI component
### User Experience
- Dark / light mode with a dedicated `ThemeToggle` and `ThemeProvider`
- Responsive layout with sticky header and backdrop blur
- Mobile-aware layout using `use-mobile` hook and a floating dock navigation
- Shadcn-based UI primitives for consistent look-and-feel
---
## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui + custom UI components
- **State Management**: Zustand (`media-store` for media state)
- **Forms & Validation**: React Hook Form + Zod
- **Auth**: Better Auth (`@/lib/auth`)
- **Database**: Neon Postgres with Drizzle ORM + migrations in `drizzle/`
- **Uploads**: UploadThing for media image handling
- **Charts / Visualization**: Recharts-backed `chart` UI wrapper
- **Utilities**: SWR for data fetching, date-fns, clsx/cva for styling
---
## How It Works
1. User signs up or logs in through the auth forms.
2. Authenticated users are redirected to the main AniLog dashboard.
3. The dashboard loads user-specific media data from the Postgres database via Drizzle.
4. Users can:
   - Add new anime/manga/manhwa entries via modals.
   - Upload or change cover images using UploadThing.
   - Edit status, progress, and other metadata.
5. Changes are persisted to the database and reflected in the `MediaTabs` and `MediaList` views, with charts and summaries powered via Recharts where needed.
---
## Current Status
**Completed**
- Authentication and session handling
- Protected main dashboard (`app/page.tsx`) with header and theme toggle
- Core media components:
  - `MediaTabs`
  - `MediaList`
  - `MediaCard`
  - Add / edit entry modals
- Upload pipeline for media images
- Core schema and migrations for media and auth (`schema/`, `drizzle/`)
- Theming and reusable UI primitives
**Planned**
- More advanced filtering and search across large libraries
- Rich statistics and charts for watch/read history
- Social features (sharing lists, activity feed)
- Public profile pages and sharable lists
- Advanced sorting and custom tags/collections
---
## Highlights
- Uses modern **Next.js 16 + React 19** features with a typed, modular architecture.
- Strong **TypeScript** types across schemas, store, and components.
- **Drizzle ORM** and Neon provide a clean and safe database layer.
- Uploads and image handling are abstracted behind a simple UI and action layer.
- The design emphasizes a cozy, focused experience for tracking anime, manga, and manhwa without clutter.
