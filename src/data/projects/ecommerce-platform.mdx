# E-Commerce Platform

## Overview

This is a full-featured e-commerce platform that allows users to browse products, add them to cart, and complete purchases with a seamless checkout experience.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Product catalog with search and filters
- Shopping cart functionality
- Secure checkout with Stripe
- Order tracking and history
- Admin dashboard for inventory management

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with React and uses Redux for state management. Key features include:

- **Component-based architecture** for reusability
- **React Router** for client-side routing
- **Redux Toolkit** for simplified state management
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling

### Backend Architecture

The backend is built with Node.js and Express:

- **RESTful API** design
- **MongoDB** for flexible data storage
- **JWT** for authentication
- **Stripe** integration for payments

## Challenges & Solutions

### Real-time Inventory

The biggest challenge was keeping inventory counts accurate across multiple concurrent users. I solved this by implementing optimistic UI updates with server-side validation.

### Payment Security

Ensuring PCI compliance was critical. I used Stripe's hosted checkout to minimize security risks while maintaining a seamless user experience.

## Results

- 99.9% uptime since launch
- Average page load time under 2 seconds
- Successfully processed 1000+ orders
